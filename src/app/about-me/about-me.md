Hello, I'm Matt, a Full Stack Developer based in New York City area.

I enjoy getting my hands on all aspects of the technology stack.  My goal is to always build and contribute to products that provide user friendly and performant experiences.

After graduating from Penn State University with degrees in both Electrical Engineering and German, I joined the Engineering Leadership Development Program at Siemens.  This program provided me many great opportunities, and it was this program that led me to the world of software development.  During my time as a Full Stack Developer at Siemens, I contributed to wide variety of interesting projects.

I consider myself a lifelong learner, and am always seeking to improve.  I recognize that skills are built through experience and practice.  They will not appear overnight.  My goal is to never become complacent, and to always seek new ways of thinking.
